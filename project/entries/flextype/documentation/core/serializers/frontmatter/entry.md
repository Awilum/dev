    description: As Jackson suffers from a fatal dose of radiation, he struggles with the value of his life while his friends deal with the emotional and diplomatic repercussions.
    director: William Waring
    writers: Brad Wright, Jonathan Glassner
    stars: Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping
    ---
    SG-1 returns from an off-world mission to P9Y-3C3 with Daniel Jackson suffering from what is likely a fatal dose of radiation. On the planet, they dealt with the country of Kelowna and their representative Jonas Quinn. That country was at the same stage of development as the United States in the 1940s and well on their way to creating an atomic weapon using Goa'uld technology found in an ancient temple. Daniel argued against the Kelownans developing such a weapon and is accused of attempting to sabotage the project. As members of the team sit by his deathbed, Daniel receives an unexpected offer from someone they once met off-world."

$data = flextype('serializers')->frontmatter()->decode($frontmatter);
