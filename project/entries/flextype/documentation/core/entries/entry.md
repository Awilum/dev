Entries are the fundamental building blocks of your Flextype powered project. Entries are a local **flat files** or an **external resources** that can be represented as a PHP array that can be used in the controllers, templates or etc...

By default, Flextype support such **flat files** formats for entries:

#### Frontmatter _Jekyll_ (.md)

<div class="file-header">[icon name="file-text" set="bootstrap"] project/entries/movies/sg-1/season-5/episode-21/entry.md</div>

```text

title: Meridian
description: As Jackson suffers from a fatal dose of radiation, he struggles with the value of his life while his friends deal with the emotional and diplomatic repercussions.
director: William Waring
writers: Brad Wright, Jonathan Glassner
stars: Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping
&minus;&minus;&minus;
SG-1 returns from an off-world mission to P9Y-3C3 with Daniel Jackson suffering from what is likely a fatal dose of radiation. On the planet, they dealt with the country of Kelowna and their representative Jonas Quinn. That country was at the same stage of development as the United States in the 1940s and well on their way to creating an atomic weapon using Goa'uld technology found in an ancient temple. Daniel argued against the Kelownans developing such a weapon and is accused of attempting to sabotage the project. As members of the team sit by his deathbed, Daniel receives an unexpected offer from someone they once met off-world.

### <a name="entries-and-urls-structure"></a> Entries and Urls structure in Flextype

All content entries are located in the `project/entries/` folder.

Each entry file `entry.md` should be placed in its own folder.

Folder names should also be valid **slugs**. Slugs are entirely lowercase, with accented characters replaced by letters from the Latin alphabet and whitespace characters replaced by a dash or an underscore, to avoid being encoded.

##### Examples

```
# Physical Location
project/entries/movies/sg-1/entry.md

# ID (URL)
movies/sg-1

# Slug
sg-1
```

```
# Physical Location
project/entries/movies/sg-1/season-5/entry.md

# ID (URL)
movies/sg-1/season-5

# Slug
season-5
```

```
# Physical Location
project/entries/movies/sg-1/season-5/episode-21/entry.md

# ID (URL)
movies/sg-1/season-5/episode-21

# Slug
episode-21
```

### <a name="default-variables"></a> Default Variables

There are a number of default entry variables available for each entry and defined in the Front Matter section.

##### <a name="default-variables-visibility"></a> Visibility

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>visibility</td>
            <td>visible</td>
            <td>visible or draft or hidden</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Content visibility is about controlling who can see your entries. Flextype allows you to control the visibility of your entries on an individual basis. By default, all entries are visible.

**Examples**

    ---
    title: My Entry Title
    visibility: draft
    ---
    My entry content here.

##### <a name="default-variables-routable"></a> Routable

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>routable</td>
            <td>true</td>
            <td>true or false</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


By default, all entries are routable. This means that they can be reached by pointing your browser to the URL of the entry. However, you may need to create a specific entry to hold specific content, but it is meant to be called directly by a plugin, other content, or even a theme directly.

**Examples**

    ---
    title: Commment42
    routable: false
    ---
    Content for Commment42

##### <a name="default-variables-published-at"></a> Published at

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>published_at</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Date & Time</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


This variable allows you to specifically set a published_at date associated with this entry.

**Examples**

    ---
    title: My Entry Title
    published_at: '15-05-2020 06:57'
    ---
    My entry content here.

##### <a name="default-variables-published-by"></a> Published by

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>published_by</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>User UUID</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


This variable allows you to specifically set a published_by User UUID associated with this entry.

**Examples**

    ---
    title: My Entry Title
    published_by: ea7432a3-b2d5-4b04-b31d-1c5acc7a55e2
    ---
    My entry content here.

##### <a name="default-variables-created-at"></a> Created at

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>created_at</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Date & Time</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

This variable allows you to specifically set a created_at date associated with this entry.

##### <a name="default-variables-modified-at"></a> Modified at

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>modified_at</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Date & Time</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

This variable allows you to specifically set a modified_at date associated with this entry.

**Examples**

    ---
    title: My Entry Title
    modified_at: '15-05-2020 06:57'
    ---
    My entry content here.

##### <a name="default-variables-parsers"></a> Parsers

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>parsers</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>A list of parsers with options</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


```yaml
parsers:
  markdown:
    enabled: true
    fields: ['content', 'title']
  shortcodes:
    enabled: true
    fields: ['content', 'title', 'description']
```

##### <a name="default-variables-cache"></a> Cache

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Available values for option</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>cache</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>true or false</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


By default, all entries are stored in the cache if flextype cache is true.
But this rule can be changed by setting individual cache for each entry.

##### <a name="default-variables-slug"></a> Slug

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>slug</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Slug is entirely lowercase, with accented characters replaced by letters from the Latin alphabet and whitespace characters replaced by a dash or an underscore, to avoid being encoded.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

$options = [
    'filter' => [
        // Return items.
        // Valid values: all, first, last, next, random, shuffle
        'return' => 'all',

        // Filters the array items by a given condition.

##### Fetch entries collection

**Examples**

Fetch collections of entries episodes in `movies/sg-1/season-5`

```php
$data = flextype('entries')->fetch('movies/sg-1/season-5', $options);
```

Fetch collections of entries in `movies/sg-1` and send `$options`.

```php
$data = flextype('entries')->fetch('movies/sg-1/season-5', $options);
```

`$options` is an array of valid values for <code>[find](https://github.com/flextype/flextype/blob/dev/src/flextype/Support/Helpers/FindHelper.php)</code> and <code>[filter](https://github.com/flextype/flextype/blob/dev/src/flextype/Support/Helpers/FilterHelper.php)</code> helpers.

### <a name="extending"></a> Extending

Entries are "macroable", which allows you to add additional methods to the Entries API at run time.

For example, the following code adds a `fetchRecentPosts()` method to the Entries API.

**Examples**

```php
// Create new macros for fetch recent posts.
flextype('entries')::macro('fetchRecentPosts', function($limit = 10) {
    return flextype('entries')
                ->fetchCollection('blog')
                ->sortBy('publised_at')
                ->limit($limit);
});

// Display recent posts.
foreach (flextype('entries')->fetchRecentPosts(5) as $post) {
    echo $post['title'] . "\n";
}
```

As you can see, the macro method takes as arguments a name and an [anonymous function](https://php.net/manual/functions.anonymous.php) to call (optionally, you able to add additional arguments, if you need that).

When you call a macro, your code in function would be called from the context of that class (in the example it is Entries API class context), allowing you to execute your code along with Flextype built-in features.

#### Using mixins

Macros awesome, and you may want to use a lot of them. You may group them with help of mixins.
For this approach, you should use a mixin static method on the macroable Entries API class, and pass your mixin class as an argument.

**Examples**


```php
// Blog Mixin Class.
class BlogMixin {
    public function fetchRecentPosts() {
        return function($limit = 10) {
            return flextype('entries')
                        ->fetchCollection('blog')
                        ->sortBy('publised_at')
                        ->limit($limit);
        }
    }
}

// Create new mixin BlogMixin with it is macros.
flextype('entries')::mixin(new BlogMixin());

// Display recent posts.
foreach (flextype('entries')->fetchRecentPosts(5) as $post) {
    echo $post['title'] . "\n";
}
```
